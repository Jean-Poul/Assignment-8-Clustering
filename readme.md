## Tasks

### Task 1, Work through the book – build your own K Means cluster function and carry out the modelling done in the book.
We followed the guide in chapter 20 of the Data science from scratch book. The results can be seen in the jupyter notebook.
### Task 2 Write a brief description of the use cases for K Means and DBSCAN algorithms.
#### K-means Use cases
Since K-means is a clustering algorithms its use cases are primarily finding similarity in the data.  
This means that we can use it when processing pictures.  
Both for changing(scaling, pixel colors) the image or finding other similiar pictures in a search engine.     
Its also a quite useful tool for finding anomalies/outliers in the data.  
It also used alot in document classification. To find similarities in documents by converting the text into vectors.   
Lastly it can be used in market analysation and can be used to group customers into clusters and use this information in marketing or product recommendations.
#### DBSCAN use cases


### Task 3, Thinking about these two algorithms provide a formal definition of clustering
Clustering is a technique used in machine learning to group data together. Usually, if the algorithm is used correctly, data with similiar characteristics(features) will be grouped together. And likewise data with dissimiliar characteristics should not be grouped together. These grouped are referred to as clusters.


### Task 4, Describe with examples of plotting two ways of selecting the value of K for K-means clustering
